# Fundamentals
**What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?**
**Spring** is a lightweight framework for building Java applications. It provides support for various aspects of application development, including dependency injection, AOP, transaction management and more.

Spring is highly configurable and provides a lot of flexibility, but configuring a Spring application can require a fair amount of boilerplate code. For instance, with setting up an external servlet container or configuration of data sources and transaction management for database access

**Spring Boot** is built on top of the Spring Framework greatly speeds up development time. It provides additional capabilities, such as auto-configuration, an embedded servlet container (Tomcat or Jetty), and production-ready features. Additionally, Spring Boot reduces the amount of boilerplate code required by providing a set of conventions and defaults for configuring Spring applications.

In summary, **Spring Framework** provides a powerful and flexible framework for building Java applications and **Spring Boot** builds on top of it to simplify and streamline the development process.
